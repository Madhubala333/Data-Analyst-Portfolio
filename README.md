# Madhuabla Malayadri - Data Analyst Portfolio
## About
I am a Data Analyst with a background in Engineering Management. My curiosity about problem-solving and data-driven decision-making led me to the field of data analytics, where I’ve found a deep passion for uncovering insights from data.

I’ve always been fascinated by numbers and patterns, and data analytics has become a natural fit for my skills. My career in engineering management has equipped me with strong analytical, problem-solving, and project management skills. I have learned to think strategically and use data to drive informed decisions.
With a Master’s degree in Engineering Management, I’ve developed solid experience in managing complex systems, analyzing data, and optimizing processes. These experiences have sharpened my ability to identify trends, detect patterns, and extract meaningful insights. I am excited to bring these skills into my work as a Data Analyst.

In my free time, I explore new data analysis tools and techniques, always looking for opportunities to enhance my skills. Whether working independently or collaboratively, I am driven by the excitement of discovering actionable insights and solving complex problems. I am confident in handling large datasets, deriving insights, and effectively communicating my findings to both technical and non-technical audiences through visualizations and dashboards.

## Portfolio Projects

### Data Warehouse Project using SQL Server
**Code:**(https://github.com/Madhubala333/SQL-Data-Warehouse-Project/tree/main/scripts)

**Goal:** To build a data warehouse by extracting data from Excel and loading it into SQL Server for structured analysis.

**Description:** This project involved designing a data warehouse from scratch using SQL Server with Excel files as the data source. I built a star schema consisting of a central fact table connected to multiple dimension tables. The ETL process was performed manually using Excel and T-SQL to extract, clean, and load the data. The final model was optimized for analytics and reporting, providing a strong foundation for future BI tools like Tableau etc.

**Skills:** Data warehousing, ETL (Extract, Transform, Load),SQL, dimensional modeling.

**Technology:** Excel, SQL Server, SSMS (SQL Server Management Studio), T-SQL.

**Results:** Deployed a fully functional data warehouse structure demonstrating data integration and dimensional modeling best practices.

### Sales Dashboard Project using Tableau
**Tableau Link:**(https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/madhubala.malayadri/viz/SalesDashboard2023_17455201838250/SalesDashboard)

**Goal:** To create an interactive and insightful Sales Dashboard that visualizes key metrics and trends to help businesses make data-driven decisions.

**Description:** Developed an interactive Sales Dashboard in Tableau to track sales quantity, sales and profit trends, and analyze sales by sub-category. The dashboard includes filters for deep data exploration.

**Skills:** dTableau Data Visualization, KPI Tracking, Time-Series Analysis.

**Technology:** Tableau, Excel/CSV

**Results:** Gained insights into sales performance and trends, enabling informed decision-making.
